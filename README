== ABOUT
Quicktest - A utility for inlining ruby unit tests with the ruby code under test

The typical test driven development workflow requires constant switching between the file containg the source code and the the file containg the tests. When creating code, it is much faster to be able to place tests immediately after the code you are writing.  After the code has been written, it may be a good idea to move it to another file.

Quicktest is designed to support quick tests in a framework agnostic way.  Currently, only an rspec testrunner is available, but it is trivial to write one for another testing framework.

== FEATURES
Quicktest uses method tracing to know the method you are testing. By default the output of a failed test will show the object and method name.

== USAGE
To test a method, place another method called 'quicktest' immediately after it
the quicktest method has one OPTIONAL argument
- a method object for the method under test

run with

  spec -r quicktest file_to_test

There is a convenience script so that you can just run

  quickspec file_to_test

== NOTES
- leaving test code in with your production code is not necessarily a good idea, but there is almost no runtime overhead to doing so since ruby will not evaluate code in a method until the method is invoked
- quicktest instance methods not working properly? if the class (or one of its ancestors) is overriding method tracing than including QuickTest::Tracer will fix it.


example: run with bin/quickspec
=end rdoc

class Foo
  attr_reader :bar

  def initialize
    @bar = true
  end
  def quicktest
    it "bar should be initialized to true" do
      bar.should == true
    end
  end

  def self.hello arg
    "hello" + arg
  end
  def self.quicktest meth
    it "should prepend 'hello' to its argument" do
      meth["world"].should == 'hello world' # error - no space 'helloworld'
    end
  end
end

Running quicktest on the sourc of this README file outputs the following:
.F

'Foo hello should prepend 'hello' to its argument' FAILED
expected: "hello world",
     got: "helloworld" (using ==)
